The purpose of the Linux Documentation Project (LDP) is to create and distribute free GNU/ Linux documenations to fill in gaps between applications and utilities that already exist.
	
This information is distributed through the internet for free and anyone may contribute to the LDP.

Currently, one of the main projects of the LDP is writing HOWTOs.
